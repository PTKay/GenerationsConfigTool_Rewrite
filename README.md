# GenerationsConfigTool_Rewrite

Rewriting Sonic Generations' Configuration Tool because why not.

Current features:

- Supports Graphics, Audio and Analytics configuration
- Supports fixing the registry to avoid the `Game files either missing or corrupt please reinstall` issue
- Supports proper scaling
- Includes settings descriptions and images to better visualize the impact of each one

Current drawbacks:
- Unable to detect all of your audio devices, meaning it only sets it to `Default` or `None`
- No input configuration yet
- Still no proper Nvidia Optimus support, just like the original configuration tool
