IncludeApp was a game monitoring system that provided developers with detailed information regarding how their games were played.
        
If you agreed to activate this feature, your game would upload data that could be used to analyse your game-play experience.
        
IncludeApp was discontinued, so no data is currently being sent, although the data is still being collected from the game offline if you opt into the service.</system:String>
